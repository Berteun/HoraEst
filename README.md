Hora Est Pebble Watchface
=========================

A watch face using the 2.0 SDK  that shows the time in Roman Numerals and the
date according to the roman calendar.

See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Calendar#Months) for a detailed
explanation. In general days are counted towards three reference days: Kalends,
Ides and Nones.

Due to the high variably of the width of Roman numerals, the layout is not ideal.

When it comes to the time, in reality the Romands divided the daylight hours in
twelve, so the lenght of the hour varied as the seasons changed. This is to be
implemented next, but will need some sort of Javascript work on the phone, to
extract the location.

This is also why I'm already using the 2.0 SDK.
